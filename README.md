# PP-friends


Purely Platonic Friends application

For deployment setup, we are using GCP so to access the application you can send us your IP and then clone the repository. Once the repository is cloned you can go to master and in a terminal run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Then in a new terminal run the following commands: `cd server` and then `python myapp.py`

Once those have been run go to http://localhost:3000/
